**Hello there, bug testers!**

## Reporting an issue
Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/JappaWakka/pkmnbrown3d/issues).

If your issue has already been reported, please leave a comment to note that you have experienced it too. Note any different circumstances and if possible include a screenshot, video or save file.

If your issue has not been reported, please create a new one. Please include what you were doing before the bug occurred and how it occurred. If you can, please also include the following:

* A screenshot, video or Twitch clip.
* A copy of your save file from before the bug occurred or just after.

### Important notes

* Please take regular backups of your save file.
* Please update your game as soon as a beta is released. You will be pinged.
* Remember to back up your save file before updating.

### What we are looking for

* Spelling and grammar.
* Continuity issues.
* Lack of direction or clarity, or progression confusion.
* Glitches and game crashes.
* Anything else you think is worth noting.

## Gameplay Tips 
* You can also move the cursor all the way to the left and change some settings. Select Options and then one of the buttons in that submenu.
 * For example, if you prefer the GameBoy soundtrack over the Orchestral one, you can disable the Brown 3D Orchestral pack in the ContentPacks menu.
* To return to the Main Menu or cancel anything, you can press the E key or the right mouse button.
* The rest of the settings (like text speed and mouse sensitivity) can only be changed while in-game. You can access the in-game Options menu by pressing the E key after the intro cutscene and selecting Options.
* On the wall in your room, there's a note explaining the controls. In first person you can only move forward (with the W key) and turn (with the A and D keys or the mouse). It's not possible to strafe yet.
* If the first person movement disorients you at first, you can press F5 to switch to a third person perspective, which allows you to move in all 4 directions with W, A, S, and D.

## History
![Merson Cave 1F](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3194707-bf56-4fb0-b48b-9bf896c89cc3)
Since roughly 3 years (probably longer) I've been in the development team for the fangame [Pok√©mon 3D](https://pokemon3d.net/) as a programmer.
The main "selling point" of Pok√©mon 3D (in my opinion) is the ability to see the world from the player's perspective in first person.

Over the years, I've implemented a lot of functionality into Pok√©mon 3D that makes it possible to create custom campaigns and stories. We call them "GameModes".

So, after finishing my previous project, [a 3D remake of the creepypasta Pok√©mon Lost Silver](https://github.com/JappaWakka/LostSilver3DRemastered), I was looking for something bigger to recreate, and I found Pok√©mon Brown. An attempt at remaking Pok√©mon Brown for Pok√©mon 3D had already been made way in the past, but it definitely needed to be massively overhauled.

Now after more than a year of hard work and valuable insight into the development of Pok√©mon Brown's 2024 update, Pok√©mon Brown 3D is (hopefully) finally ready for testing!
