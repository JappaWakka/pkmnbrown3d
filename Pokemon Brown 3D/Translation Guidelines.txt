The localization file is a simple .txt file, renamed to .dat, which can be opened by any text editor (Notepad++ for example).

To start, make a copy of "Tokens_en.dat" inside the "Content\Localization\" folder of the Pokémon Brown 3D GameMode and change the "en" to your language's suffix.
Look in the "Content\Localization\" folder of the regular game for the available language suffixes.

Each token has a name (the value before the first comma) and content (everything after the first comma). The token name should not be changed.

To update/refresh the currently loaded tokens, you have to exit to the main menu and start your savegame again.

You can write ~ in places where you want a soft line break (which scrolls to the next line, keeping the last previous line in view)
You can write * in places where you want a hard line break (which clears the text box before displaying the next line)

If you want to quickly test some strings (for example to check if it's not too long), you can press T and then type "@Text.Show(string)" (without quotations) to show the string between the brackets.
You can also show tokens from the token file by pressing T and then typing "@Text.Show(<system.token(tokenName)>)" (without quotations) to show the token with the specified name between the brackets.

For dialogue to fit in the text box I usually try to keep a line under 30 characters.
Sometimes you can go over that as not all characters are equally wide (periods and the letter i for example are less wide) but that's usually the safe range.

Player names (which replace <player.name>) can be max. 10 characters long.
Pokémon nicknames (which replace various <pokemon.nickname(...)> can be max. 14 characters long.
