How to use:
This can only be played if you have installed the main Pokémon 3D game (https://pokemon3d.net/download).
After downloading the Pokemon Brown 3D zip file, extract it using WinRAR or 7zip, and move the folder called "Pokemon Brown 3D" to the GameModes folder inside the main Pokémon 3D folder.
Once the Pokemon Brown 3D folder is in the GameModes folder, you can launch the game, scroll all the way to the right and start a new game using the GameMode.
