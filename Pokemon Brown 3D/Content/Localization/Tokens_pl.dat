VoltorbFlip_BeforeGame_NoCoinCase,You don't have a Coin Case!~Come back when you have one!

VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Message,Voltorb Flip is a game in which~you flip over cards to find~numbers hidden beneath them.*The cards are hiding the~numbers 1 through 3...~and Voltorb as well.*The first number you flip over~will give you that many Coins.*From then on, the next number~you find will multiply the~total amount of Coins you've~collected by that number.*If it's a 2, your total will~be multiplied by "x2".*If it's a 3, your total will~be multiplied by "x3".*But if you flip over a~Voltorb, it's game over.*When that happens, you'll lose~all the Coins you've collected~in the current level.*If you select "Quit", you'll~withdraw from the level.*If you get to a difficult~spot, you might want to end~the game early.*Once you've found all the~hidden 2 and 3 cards,~you've cleared the game.*Once you've flipped over~all these cards, then you'll~advance to the next level.*As you move up in levels,~you will be able to receive~more Coins. Do your best!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Message,The numbers at the side~of the board give you a clue~about the numbers hidden on~the backs of the cards.*The larger the number, the~more likely it is that there~are many large numbers hidden~in that row or column.*In the same way, you can tell~how many Voltorb are hidden~in the row or column.*Consider the hidden number~totals and the Voltorb~totals carefully as you~flip over cards.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_AboutMemos_Message,Select "Open Memo" or press~[<system.button(run)>] to open the~Memo Window.*You can mark the cards with~the numbers 1 through 3,~but also with a Voltorb mark.*When you have an idea of the~numbers hidden on the back~of the cards, open the Memo~Window, choose the type of~mark you want to use with~the Mouse Wheel or the~Gamepad's Shoulder Buttons~and then press [<system.button(enter1)>]~while highlighting the card~you want to mark.*If you want to remove a mark,~choose the type of mark you~want to remove with the~Mouse Wheel or the Gamepad's~Shoulder Buttons and then~press [<system.button(back1)>] while~highlighting the card you~want to remove the mark from.*You can also use the~mouse to select a~mark type or a card.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image1,If you flip the cards in this order, you'll collect: 3 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3... A total of 18 Coins! And then...
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image2,If you select "Quit", you'll keep those 18 Coins.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image3,But if you find Voltorb, you'll lose all your Coins!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Image,By looking at the numbers on the sides of the cards, you can see the hidden number and Voltorb totals.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_AboutMemos_Image,Select "Open Memo" to open the Memo Window. Select the cards and press [<system.button(enter1)>] to add and [<system.button(back1)>] to remove marks.

League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Question,Who do you want to know about?
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Redd,Rijon's first Elite Four~member! Redd specializes in~the Fire-type.*Always hot and ready for~battle, she used to be a~member of the Kanto Pokémon~Federation, hence she is~always on her beloved bike.*It is said she was powerful~enough to terrify all of the~other members of the gang,~thereby attracting the~attention of the Rijon League.*It is said that nothing can~scare Redd, who, legend says,~fought off a wild Ursaring~with her bare hands.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Jared,Jared learned all he knows~from his cousin Koga,~the Poison-type Gym Leader~of Kanto.*Since both of them are ninjas,~they would constantly go out~and... "practice" their skills~in the old days.*What they were practicing on,~nobody knows, but it has been~said that both have since seen~the light and are completely~and totally reformed.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Agatha,Agatha is a former member of~Kanto's Elite Four, and held~the record of being the~youngest in history to attain~such a title before Blanch~came along.*Agatha resigned her position~to move to the Rijon League~because "the challengers are~less pathetic" here, or so she claims.*Back in the old days,~there were stories of her~relationship with Professor~Oak, a respected and famous~researcher from Kanto.*Rumors of a messy break-up and~an illegitimate child have~dogged them for many years.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Drake,A dragon master hailing from~the legendary Dragon Clan~of Johto.*For many years, he proved~himself worthy of the title~of leader of the Rijon~Elite Four.*But then, along came Blanch,~who crushed him into a pulp.*It was certainly quite a~shock; not just for him, but~for all of Rijon.*After that loss, he embarked~on a training journey that~spanned the known world...*From Naljo to Onwa to Aster...~but, nobody knows his~whereabouts today.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Blanch,By far the youngest member of~Rijon's Elite Four, Blanch is~relatively new to the role.*She is known to be immature~and goofy at times, but she~knows when to focus and can be~totally ferocious when she~needs to be.*She was actually~excommunicated from Johto's~Dragon Clan by the leader~Clair herself for reckless~behaviour and disregard for~their sacred laws.*Since then, she's made it her~quest to prove them all wrong,~and since defeating Drake and~claiming his title, she might~have succeeded!
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Outro,Come back any time!

League_Elite4_Red_IntroMessage,Redd: Welcome to the Rijon~League, <Player.Name>.*<Player.Name>: You know my name?~Who are you?*Redd: The name's Redd, and~I'll be your first opponent in~the Rijon League.*We've heard a lot about you.~As for me, my fire Pokémon are~tough, rough, and ready.*Watch me rev right up and~leave you and your team in~flames!

League_Elite4_Jared_DefeatMessage,Jared: My job is done! Go face~your next challenge!

Haha!
League_Elite4_Blanch_OutroMessage,Blanch: Wh--wha...*No...
League_Elite4_Blanch_DefeatMessage,Blanch: ...you...beat...me...?*I can't believe this, but you~won fair and square.*To add insult to injury,~I just lost to this OTHER~dumb kid earlier today.*Think his name was Mura, or~something like that.*If you want to become~Champion, you gotta beat~that other guy first.*Follow me.
League_Elite4_Blanch_Door,Blanch: Mura is waiting behind~this door.*Wish you luck.

League_Champion_Mura_IntroMessage,Mura: Hey!*<Player.Name>: You're the~Champion?*Mura: Yep, I told you I would~be the best Pokémon trainer~ever!*<Player.Name>: I... can't believe~this...*Blanch was hard enough...~I almost lost to her but you~beat her before me.*Mura: There's only one way to~settle this...*<Player.Name>: I think I know what~you mean.*Mura: Let's do it then and~prove who's the real Champion~of Rijon!
League_Champion_Mura_OutroMessage,Mura: NO! DANG IT!*That wasn't fair!*<Player.Name>: Well I'm sorry to~say, that I'm the Champion~now.

MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_Intro,<player.name>: That Tepig is~operating the DJ set!~Incredible!*Alex: Thank you.~Hi, I am AlexCorruptor, but~you can call me Alex.*<player.name>: And you can talk?!*Alex: Well... yeah... it's a~long story...
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_FirstTime,Are you looking for~JappaWakka?*<player.name>: Yeah, I am!*Alex: He's at the bridge of~the ship, up the stairs to~the right.*By the way, if you'd like to~hear a different song, choose~the one you want on the~DJ set.
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_BeforeJappa,Alex: JappaWakka is at the~bridge of the ship, up the~stairs to the right. If you'd~like to hear a different song,~choose the one you want on the~DJ set.
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_AfterJappa_Intro,Alex: ...Jappa is worried~about me, you say?*Hmm... Maybe I should tell you~about my worries.*It's gonna be long, so~listen up.
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_AfterJappa_Story,You see, I am not from this~region, and my journey up~until now hasn't exactly been~smooth either, so let me tell~you all about it from the~beginning.*I was born in the Unova region~and when I grew up, I started~growing fond of the Tepig~evolution line.*I had a few of those and we~were hugging all the time.*One day, I woke up in a world~unknown to me, with a voice~calling for help.*I looked down, saw my~reflection and saw that I~transformed into a shiny Tepig.*Suddenly I was up in the sky~and started falling down~hitting some of the trees in~the process.*Shortly after I met 3 other~Pokémon:~Roffe the Snivy,~Lossy the Axew,~and Jappa the Oshawott.*We became friends very quickly~and we started adventuring~together as a team.*We faced many different~battles, puzzles and other~Pokémon who needed help.*At one point, we encountered~a Hydreigon who ended up~following me specifically,~which initially gave me an~idea that he know who I was.*In the end, we defeated the~greatest evil that was~threatening the entire world.*Soon after this, it was my~time to go back to the normal~world and to never come back.*All 3 of my friends, Roffe,~Lossy and Jappa were sad to~see me go, they even begged~for me to stay, but it seemed~that the balance of nature~would've shifted if that were~to happen.*I started glowing and~ascending slowly, marking the~end of our adventures.*Before I finally got back to~the normal world I looked down~at them, they were crying,~and I wished that I didn't~have to leave that world.*When I returned to the normal~world, I found myself in Ilex~Forest, still as a shiny Tepig.*I realised that I still had~the ability to talk to the~other Pokémon, but I hadn't~encountered any humans yet.*Soon enough I met JappaWakka,~who was a nice guy, and we~were able to talk to each~other without any problem,~which meant that I could talk~to humans too.*He told me about this ship~that he was trying to build~where I could stay and learn~more about myself, and I ended~up becoming interested in~creating music.*Almost all the stuff that you~hear in this club, including~what's currently playing, was~composed or covered by me.*I also learned about ciphers~which are used to decode~stuff, and about 4-dimensional~hypercubes like the one~hanging from the ceiling.*I still think about all the~friends I made back in that~world, while also wondering~whether Jappa from that world~and JappaWakka from this~world are the same or not.*I avoid telling him about~these experiences, because~I'm not sure what he'd think of~it all...*As of late, I've started~dreaming about that world,~with Hydreigon seeming to~know that I am watching.*Whether that means anything,~I don't know, but I still wish~that I could get back there...*Well, <player.name>, I hope you~can relate to me on any level...
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_JappaWakka,JappaWakka: Hey, <Player.Name>!~Have you heard from Alex yet?*<Player.Name>: Well, from his~story remembered that the~first time he appeared back~in this world.... he found~himself in Ilex Forest.*Maybe it's worth looking for~him there!*JappaWakka: Good idea!~Keep me up to date!

MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_FirstTalk1,JappaWakka: Hiya, <Player.Name>!*Welcome to my ship: Madame~Renifler! Built it myself,~pretty proud of it.*Don't worry, it's perfectly~safe. My good buddy Alex~helped me out a lot.*He's got a nose for finding~things that need improvement~and fixing.*Have you met him yet? He's the~Tepig operating the DJ set in~the dance room below.*I'm kinda worried about Alex~though. There seems to be~something troubling him, but~he seems to not want to talk~about it. If you're able to,~please let him know he can~always tell me anything and~that I'm there for him if he~needs me.
MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_FirstTalk2,JappaWakka: Hiya, <Player.Name>!~Have you met Alex yet?

MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_AfterAlexStory1,JappaWakka: Have you met~Alex? What did he say?*...*I see.*Well that explains a lot. I'm~glad I know what's going on.*I don't have a lot of~knowledge about different~universes, but I mean... with~Pokémon, anything is possible!*Who knows, maybe he'll be able~to return to that Pokémon~world one day! We'll see, but~until that happens I'll just~try to be the best friend I~can be in this one. Thanks for~telling me, <Player.Name>.*Here, I got you something to~remember us by.
MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_ReceiveSniffCat,<Player.Name> received a framed~photo of a sniffing cat!
MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_AfterAlexStory2,You can hang it on the wall of~your room if you like.~Your computer should be able~to help you with that.

MadameRenifler_Bridge_JappaWakka_TalkAgain_GlitchedDex,JappaWakka: I'd let Professor~Tim take a look at that~Pokédex if I were you.*Anyhow, I'm glad I got the~opportunity to meet you.*I wish you the best of luck!~See ya later!

[AlexCorruptor Is Missing Quest]
Gravel_TimsLab_AlexMissing1,JappaWakka: <Player.Name>!
Gravel_TimsLab_AlexMissing2,I wanted to check on Alex, but~he was gone!*I found this note near his~DJ set...~Here's what it says:*Dear Jappa and <Player.Name>,~Sorry that I have to leave you~without any warning, but I saw~a vision of Hydreigon in front~of me... calling me...*He said I had go to a certain~place far away from Rijon and~didn't give me any other~instructions than that.*I may be gone for some time.~Perhaps I won't come back~at all.*I cannot tell at this moment.*In the meantime, do not worry~about me. I can defend myself~if forced to fight.*Again, sorry for making you~nervous. This is just very~important to me.*With love, Alex the Tepig*JappaWakka: I hope he's~alright...*Well, if you hear anything~about him, you can find me at~my ship in Castro Valley.*Someone has to keep the music~playing, right?
Seashore_PlayerHouse2F_AlexMissing3,<Player.Name>: Two days passed~and no sign of Alex yet!*Hmm... I remember from his~story that the first time he~appeared back in this world...~he found himself in Ilex Forest.*Maybe it's worth looking for~him there!
IlexForest_AlexFound1,<Player.Name>: Huh?*What's an Emboar doing in~these woods?*Wait a minute...~Alex? Is that you?
IlexForest_AlexFound2,Alex: Hm? ...Oh, it's you!*It seems that I managed to~sort out my ordeal with the~whole other world.*I didn't want to make anyone~worried, but it was really~important for me to figure it~all out.*How long was I gone?*<Player.Name>: It's been two days~since JappaWakka found the~note. He was very worried.*Alex: Two days? Strange...~I've been in the other world~for at least a month, if not~longer.*I've been given the ability to~teleport to that world and~back at will...*So I'll probably be gone every~once in a while.*I'll make sure that JappaWakka~knows of this as well.*I feel like we've got a lot~to catch up on.
CastroValley_AlexFound3,JappaWakka: Pfew! I'm glad~Alex is safe and sound!*And he evolved!*Twice!*That's so cool!*We've got a lot to talk about,~which we'll have plenty of~time for as we sail to our~next destination, wherever~our ship may lead us!*Thank you for everything,~<Player.Name>!
CastroValley_AlexFound4,Alex: So like Jappa said, we~are both setting sail to our~next destination, making this~our last chance to say~goodbye...*Not gonna lie, but I will~surely miss you, <Player.Name>.*As a token of my appreciation,~take one of my DJ sets, so you~can listen to our songs at home.*Thank you, <Player.Name>.*I hope we will meet again~someday.
