VoltorbFlip_BeforeGame_NoCoinCase,You don't have a Coin Case!~Come back when you have one!

VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Message,Voltorb Flip is a game in which~you flip over cards to find~numbers hidden beneath them.*The cards are hiding the~numbers 1 through 3...~and Voltorb as well.*The first number you flip over~will give you that many Coins.*From then on, the next number~you find will multiply the~total amount of Coins you've~collected by that number.*If it's a 2, your total will~be multiplied by "x2".*If it's a 3, your total will~be multiplied by "x3".*But if you flip over a~Voltorb, it's game over.*When that happens, you'll lose~all the Coins you've collected~in the current level.*If you select "Quit", you'll~withdraw from the level.*If you get to a difficult~spot, you might want to end~the game early.*Once you've found all the~hidden 2 and 3 cards,~you've cleared the game.*Once you've flipped over~all these cards, then you'll~advance to the next level.*As you move up in levels,~you will be able to receive~more Coins. Do your best!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Message,The numbers at the side~of the board give you a clue~about the numbers hidden on~the backs of the cards.*The larger the number, the~more likely it is that there~are many large numbers hidden~in that row or column.*In the same way, you can tell~how many Voltorb are hidden~in the row or column.*Consider the hidden number~totals and the Voltorb~totals carefully as you~flip over cards.

move_desc_1002,The user uses the underhanded tactic of spraying mist into the target eyes. This may also leave the target burned.
move_desc_1003,The user somehow sharpens a body part and attacks the target with it.
move_desc_1004,The user creates a crushing field of digital data around the target.

League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Redd,Rijon's first Elite Four~member!*Redd specializes in the~Fire-type.*Always hot and ready for~battle, she used to be a~member of the Kanto Pokémon~Federation, hence she is~always on her beloved bike.*It is said she was powerful~enough to terrify all of the~other members of the gang,~thereby attracting the~attention of the Rijon League.*It is said that nothing can~scare Redd, who, legend says,~fought off a wild Ursaring~with her bare hands.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Jared,Jared learned all he knows~from his cousin Koga,~the Poison-type Gym Leader~of Kanto.*Since both of them are ninjas,~they would constantly go out~and... "practice" their skills~in the old days.*What they were practicing on,~nobody knows, but it has been~said that both have since seen~the light and are completely~and totally reformed.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Agatha,Agatha is a former member of~Kanto's Elite Four, and held~the record of being the~youngest in history to attain~such a title before Blanch~came along.*Agatha resigned her position~to move to the Rijon League~because "the challengers are~less pathetic" here, or so~she claims.*Back in the old days,~there were stories of her~relationship with Professor~Oak, a respected and famous~researcher from Kanto.*Rumors of a messy break-up~and an illegitimate child have~dogged them for many years.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Drake,A dragon master hailing from~the legendary Dragon Clan~of Johto.*For many years, he proved~himself worthy of the title~of leader of the Rijon~Elite Four.*But then, along came Blanch,~who crushed him into a pulp.*It was certainly quite a~shock; not just for him, but~for all of Rijon.*After that loss, he embarked~on a training journey that~spanned the known world...*From Naljo to Onwa to Aster...~but, nobody knows his~whereabouts today.
League_EntranceHall_EliteFourLoreGuy_Answer_Blanch,By far the youngest member~of Rijon's Elite Four, Blanch is~relatively new to the role.*She is known to be immature~and goofy at times, but she~knows when to focus and can~be totally ferocious when she~needs to be.*She was actually~excommunicated from Johto's~Dragon Clan by the leader~Clair herself for reckless~behaviour and disregard for~their sacred laws.*Since then, she's made it her~quest to prove them all wrong,~and since defeating Drake and~claiming his title, she might~have succeeded!

MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_AfterJappa_Intro,Alex: ...Jappa is worried~about me, you say?*Hmm... Maybe I should tell you~about my worries.*It's gonna be long, so~listen up.
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_AlexCorruptor_AfterJappa_Story,You see, I am not from this~region, and my journey up~until now hasn't exactly been~smooth either, so let me tell~you all about it from the~beginning.*I was born in the Unova region~and when I grew up, I started~growing fond of the Tepig~evolution line.*I had a few of those and we~were hugging all the time.*One day, I woke up in a world~unknown to me, with a voice~calling for help.*I looked down, saw my~reflection and saw that~I transformed into a~shiny Tepig.*Suddenly I was up in the sky~and started falling down~hitting some of the trees in~the process.*Shortly after I met 3 other~Pokémon:~Roffe the Snivy,~Lossy the Axew,~and Jappa the Oshawott.*We became friends very~quickly and we started~adventuring together as~a team.*We faced many different~battles, puzzles and other~Pokémon who needed help.*At one point, we encountered~a Hydreigon who ended up~following me specifically,~which initially gave me an~idea that he know who I was.*In the end, we defeated the~greatest evil that was~threatening the entire world.*Soon after this, it was my~time to go back to the normal~world and to never come back.*All 3 of my friends, Roffe,~Lossy and Jappa were sad to~see me go, they even begged~for me to stay, but it seemed~that the balance of nature~would've shifted if that were~to happen.*I started glowing and~ascending slowly, marking the~end of our adventures.*Before I finally got back to~the normal world I looked down~at them, they were crying,~and I wished that I didn't~have to leave that world.*When I returned to the normal~world, I found myself in Ilex~Forest, still as a shiny Tepig.*I realised that I still had~the ability to talk to the~other Pokémon, but I hadn't~encountered any humans yet.*Soon enough I met~JappaWakka, who was a nice~guy, and we were able to~talk to each other without~any problem, which meant~that I could talk to~humans too.*He told me about this ship~that he was trying to build~where I could stay and learn~more about myself, and I~ended up becoming interested~in creating music.*Almost all the stuff that you~hear in this club, including~what's currently playing, was~composed or covered by me.*I also learned about ciphers~which are used to decode~stuff, and about 4-dimensional~hypercubes like the one~hanging from the ceiling.*I still think about all the~friends I made back in that~world, while also wondering~whether Jappa from that~world and JappaWakka from~this world are the same~or not.*I avoid telling him about~these experiences, because~I'm not sure what he'd think of~it all...*As of late, I've started~dreaming about that world,~with Hydreigon seeming to~know that I am watching.*Whether that means anything,~I don't know, but I still wish~that I could get back there...*Well, <player.name>, I hope you~can relate to me on any level...
MadameRenifler_DanceClub_JappaWakka,JappaWakka: Hey, <Player.Name>!~Have you heard from~Alex yet?*<Player.Name>: Well, from his~story remembered that the~first time he appeared back~in this world.... he found~himself in Ilex Forest.*Maybe it's worth looking for~him there!*JappaWakka: Good idea!~Keep me up to date!
