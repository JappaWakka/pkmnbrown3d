VoltorbFlip_BeforeGame_NoCoinCase,You don't have a Coin Case!~Come back when you have one!

VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Message,Voltorb Flip is a game in which~you flip over cards to find~numbers hidden beneath them.*The cards are hiding the~numbers 1 through 3...~and Voltorb as well.*The first number you flip over~will give you that many Coins.*From then on, the next number~you find will multiply the~total amount of Coins you've~collected by that number.*If it's a 2, your total will~be multiplied by "x2".*If it's a 3, your total will~be multiplied by "x3".*But if you flip over a~Voltorb, it's game over.*When that happens, you'll lose~all the Coins you've collected~in the current level.*If you select "Quit", you'll~withdraw from the level.*If you get to a difficult~spot, you might want to end~the game early.*Once you've found all the~hidden 2 and 3 cards,~you've cleared the game.*Once you've flipped over~all these cards, then you'll~advance to the next level.*As you move up in levels,~you will be able to receive~more Coins. Do your best!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Message,The numbers at the side~of the board give you a clue~about the numbers hidden on~the backs of the cards.*The larger the number, the~more likely it is that there~are many large numbers hidden~in that row or column.*In the same way, you can tell~how many Voltorb are hidden~in the row or column.*Consider the hidden number~totals and the Voltorb~totals carefully as you~flip over cards.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_AboutMemos_Message,Select "Open Memo" or press~[<system.button(run)>] to open the~Memo Window.*You can mark the cards with~the numbers 1 through 3,~but also with a Voltorb mark.*When you have an idea of the~numbers hidden on the back~of the cards, open the Memo~Window, choose the type of~mark you want to use with~the Mouse Wheel or the~Gamepad's Shoulder Buttons~and then press [<system.button(enter1)>]~while highlighting the card~you want to mark.*If you want to remove a mark,~choose the type of mark you~want to remove with the~Mouse Wheel or the Gamepad's~Shoulder Buttons and then~press [<system.button(back1)>] while~highlighting the card you~want to remove the mark from.*You can also use the~mouse to select a~mark type or a card.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image1,If you flip the cards in this order, you'll collect: 3 x 1 x 2 x 1 x 3... A total of 18 Coins! And then...
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image2,If you select "Quit", you'll keep those 18 Coins.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_HowToPlay_Image3,But if you find Voltorb, you'll lose all your Coins!
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_Hint_Image,By looking at the numbers on the sides of the cards, you can see the hidden number and Voltorb totals.
VoltorbFlip_Tutorial_AboutMemos_Image,Select "Open Memo" to open the Memo Window. Select the cards and press [<system.button(enter1)>] to add and [<system.button(back1)>] to remove marks.

He~was scared by most of them for~some reason or another and~didn't even like our fish~much... But rats? Cats? Birds?~He loved those. So we caught~Joe a Pidgey, way back then.~And he took darn good care of~it.*Bit of a weird fella; can't~say we talk much now. But he~made a good name for himself,~far as I'm concerned.
