# This is an example type for a GameMode.
# The default GameMode cannot load additional types, however all other GameModes can.
# The type ID must be set and must lay above 20.
# Here's a list of all properties that can be set: "ID", "Name", "TypeImageOffset", "ItemTextureSource", "ItemTextureOffset", "EffectivenessAttack", "EffectivenessDefense", "ShowInDexFilters"

# To build your own type for your GameMode, create a new file with the .dat file extension in the Content\Data\Types folder and edit/retype the lines below (be sure to remove the # at the start of each line).
