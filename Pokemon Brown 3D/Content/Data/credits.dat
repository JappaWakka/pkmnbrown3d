# This is an example file for a list of Credits Pages to add to your GameMode.
# The default GameMode doesn't use this file, however all other GameModes can.

# Each line that starts with "Credits" is one Credits Page. The format for those lines is: Credits|ID|PageTitle|Name,Name,Name...
# When you use the @Screen.Credits command, you can add an argument to it to trigger different background maps and credits. Example: @Screen.Credits(Johto)
# If the argument matches the ID of a line or if the ID of a line is empty, that Credit Page will be added.
# The value of the PageTitle argument will appear at the top.
# You can add as many names per Credit Page as you want, separated by commas (though up to 13 is recommended).

# If the line starts with "Background", instead of "Credits", it tells the game what maps to display in the background of the Credits screen.
# The format for those lines is: Background|ID|MapPath|StartX,StartY,StartZ|EndX,EndY,EndZ|Speed|Yaw|Pitch
# The ID argument works the same way as with the Credits Pages. The MapPath argument is relative to the "Data\Maps" folder.
# For the Speed argument you can use these player speeds as reference: 1 = Walk, 1.5 = Run, 2 = Ride
